### SOLUTION 1 : (FASTEST)

```
class Solution {
public:
    
    void solve(TreeNode* root, int& sum, int pointer){
        if(!root) return;
        if(root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL && pointer == 0) sum += root->val;
        solve(root->left,sum,0);
        solve(root->right,sum,1);
    }
    
    int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        int sum = 0;
        solve(root,sum,6);
        return sum;
    }
};

There were other ways too like iterative using pre-order traversal : https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/solution/ <br>
Recursion : In solution recrusive approach we add if it's left but we keep total zero if it's right and return 0 only, so we add sum on left calls and we add 0 on right calls but in my way I just ignored the right addition and if it's a right call then just don't do anything cause it's a void function.
