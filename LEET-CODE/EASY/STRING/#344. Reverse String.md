## Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[]. <br>
### Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### SOLUTION : BEST METHOD

```
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = s.size()-1;
        while(l<r){
            char tmp = s[l];
            s[l++] = s[r];
            s[r--] = tmp;
        }
    }
};
```
