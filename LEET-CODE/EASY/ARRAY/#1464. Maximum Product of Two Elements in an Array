Given the array of integers nums, you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. Return the maximum value of (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1).

SOLUTION : SIMPLEST ONE

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int i,j ; 
        i = n-1;
        j = n-2;
        
        return  (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1);
    }
};
