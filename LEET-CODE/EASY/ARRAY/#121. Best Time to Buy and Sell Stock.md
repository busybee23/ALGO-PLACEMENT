Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxPro= 0 ;
        int minPrice = INT_MAX;
        for(int i =0; i<prices.size();i++){
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            maxPro = max(maxPro, prices[i]-minPrice);
        }
       return maxPro; 
    }
};

INT_MAX is a macro that specifies that an integer variable cannot store any value beyond this limit. INT_MIN specifies that an integer variable cannot store any value below this limit. Values of INT_MAX and INT_MIN may vary from compiler to compiler
