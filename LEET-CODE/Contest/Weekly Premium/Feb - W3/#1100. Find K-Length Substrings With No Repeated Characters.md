### Solution 1 : (Accepted)

Without Using Sliding Window but kind of same concept with hashing 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numKLenSubstrNoRepeats(string s, int k) {
        if(k  >26) 
            return 0;
        int c = 0;
        int n = s.size();
        
        for(int i=0;i<=n-k;i++){ // n-k so that we don't jump out of bound from right side.
            // we need a freq array 
            int freq[26] = {0};
            bool flag = true;
            
            for(int j=i;j<i+k;j++) {// starting from i we are checking next k elements kind of window
            // increase the freq of our element
                freq[s[j]-'a']++;
                
            // if we got a repeated char make the flag false and don't traverse further and change your i now
                if(freq[s[j]-'a']>1){
                    flag = false;
                    break; // breaking from j loop, which is basically 5 length long, shift i forward now then come back again
                }                
            }
            if(flag) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
};
```
