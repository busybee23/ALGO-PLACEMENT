### Solution 1 : (ACCEPTED & MINE)

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> sumOfThree(long long num) {
        vector<long long> solve;
        long long ans = num-3;
        if(ans%3==0){
        long long valid = ans/3;
        solve.push_back(valid);
        solve.push_back(valid+1);
        solve.push_back(valid+2);
        }
        return solve;
    }
};
```

### Solution 2 : (FASTEST I'VE EVER SEEN )

here we knew that vector will only contain 3 numbers if all conditions falls true so we returned a vector directly using {x,y,z}; this saves us from declaring the vector, calculating the values one by one and pushing them back into the vectors.

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> sumOfThree(long long num) {
        if (num % 3 == 0) {
            return {num / 3 - 1, num / 3, num / 3 + 1};
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
