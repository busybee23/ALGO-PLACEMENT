### SOLUTION : (ACCEPTED)


// 1. add left boundary without leaves (normal)
// 2. add leaves 
// 3. add right boundary without leaves (reverse)

// it can be done by taking three different vectors too and adding them in last but that is kind of lengthy also here we have ignored recursion in // left and right calls because we didn't wanted to come back, tracing to the depth was our only moto so we use another tree node (cur) to capture // our root and worked with it so that out main node don't get disturbed 

// res was declared in main function and was sent by reference because we were calling left, leaves and right function in a sequence and they all were adding values to the (res) vector
// we only reversed in right because we wanted anti clock wise traverse

```
