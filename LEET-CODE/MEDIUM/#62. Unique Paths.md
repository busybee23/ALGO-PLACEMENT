## 62. Unique Paths
### QUESTION : https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
### VIDEO : https://youtu.be/mjiAp9f6RV8

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

## SOLUTION : (Accepted) DP for submission.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int dp[m][n];
        
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(i==0){
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                }else if(j==0){
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
```
