## 62. Unique Paths
### QUESTION : https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
### VIDEO : https://youtu.be/mjiAp9f6RV8

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

## SOLUTION : RECURSION (SHOWS TLE ) using DP for submission.

```
int grid(int m, int n){
    // base case 
    if(m == 1 and n == 1 )  
        return 1;
    
    if(m < 0 || n < 0){
        return 0;
    }
    
    // recursive case 
    
    return grid(m-1,n)+ grid(m,n-1);
}

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        
        return grid(m,n) ;
        
    }
};
```
