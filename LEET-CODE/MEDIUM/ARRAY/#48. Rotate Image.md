## #48. Rotate Image
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).<br>
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 ### SOLUTION :  Transpose and Reverse

``` 
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& m) {
        int n = m.size();
        // transpose the array
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            for(int j=0;j<i;j++)
                swap(m[i][j], m[j][i]);
        //reverse it   
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            reverse(m[i].begin(), m[i].end());
        
    }
};
