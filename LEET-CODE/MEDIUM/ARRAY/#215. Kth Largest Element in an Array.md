https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.<br>

### SOLUTION : FIRST APPROACH BY ME 

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int kenny ;
            kenny = nums[nums.size()-k];
        return kenny ;
    }
};
```
